This project involves the design, simulation, and analysis of a digital communication system. The project is divided into multiple tasks, each addressing different aspects of communication system design. The main components and steps are summarized as follows:

# Project Overview:

 - Design and simulate a digital communication system.
 - Use MATLAB or Python for implementation.
 - Document all results and final reports in PDF format.


# Simulation and Implementation:

 - Implement key system blocks including the divider, pulse shaping, modulation, channel, demodulation, and matched filter.
 - Use random sequences for testing and ensure proper commenting and organization of the code.

# Tasks:

 - Task 1: Implement a function to divide the input sequence into two halves.
 - Task 2: Implement pulse shaping and modulation functions.
 - Task 3: Simulate the transmission of random bit sequences using different modulation schemes like PAM, PSK, and FSK.
 - Task 4: Simulate the transmission of 8-bit numbers, convert them to binary, and assess system performance using error probabilities.
 - Task 5: Use companding to improve system performance, especially in the presence of noise.

# Evaluation and Reporting:

 - Evaluate performance using metrics like error probability and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
 - Compare the results for different modulation schemes and noise levels.
 - Document all findings and simulations comprehensively.

# Communication System Models:

 - Block diagrams for the transmitter and receiver are provided.
 - Implement each block and test the system end-to-end.
 - Ensure results are verified with theoretical expectations.
